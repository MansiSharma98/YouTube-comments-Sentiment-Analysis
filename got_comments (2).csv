9,"It's Dec 2021 and I've just spent 2 weeks ignoring my wife as I binged GOT.

Daenerys Targaryen: 8 season only to be screwed by the writing at the finish line.
Jon Snow: prophecy which leads nowhere, cool as wolf.
Tyrion Lannister: Smart for 5 season & then instantly became dumb. (Best character).
Arya Stark: Batman.
Sansa Stark: Hated this character.
Bran Stark: Boring...The King!!!! REALLY.
Cersei Lannister: 8 season & a building kills this bitch.
Jamie Lannister:  Poor writing for this character arc. 
Brienne of Tarth: Walked the county side most of the show, great acting
Rhaegal: is. Can not see ships in open water? I call BS

I really enjoyed GOT but it fell from grace hard in the later parts of season 7 and finally season 8, but I'm grateful that I didn't invest 8 yrs into this show or I would be pissed. 
GOT is definitely in my top 10 but it is no Breaking Bad
Or The Sopranos. 

Now to watch the last season of what I believe is the  best tv sci-fi EVER.

16,There should have been a whole season dedicated to the white walkers. Like a full on apocalypse in westros where like most the population is slaughtered and they lose the battle at winterfell. City after city falling and the final battle is for kings landing with an epic fight between Jon Snow and the Night King. I hate how the whole show builds up to the white walkers being this inevitable doom only for them to just be taken down in one episode barley causing any damage to the rest of westros. Like kings landing didn't even know they existed. Winter barley came it just got a little snowy in kings landing. A whole season should have been this epic harsh apocalypse type winter undead threat. We should have felt like everything was hopeless. Then after that the next season should have been back to business as usual with the throne and Danny going crazy and dealing with Cersi (if she survived winter) that's just how it should have been. And f*ck subverting our expectations Jon was our hero and should have remained our hero and should have been the focus after we find out he was the heir to the throne. I mean for Christ sake he is Ice and Fire Stark and Targaryean. They f***ed up big time.,UgxvHXInYRoEPX-TRDt4AaABAg,Grunge Head,1,0,2021-11-11T09:09:34Z,1

20,"Two years on I'm still pissed. As Chris says, S8 was well done in every aspect except the writing. It has become extremely clear that the failure of S8 was solely due to Dave and Dan. They were tired of GOT and eager to move on, and because of that they screwed everyone. Not just the fans but the crew and actors, those 100s of people who took pride in making such a unique show that was the pinnacle of television. The looks and words of the actors in interviews or at the table reads.  HBOs repeated requests to extend the show or at least the season. Even GRRM's writing schedule for WoW was likely affected by this as fans are now eager to see him do it differently, better--and since D&D did get the overall story arc from him, he may be afraid he can't do it any better (I'm thinking of Bran here, but this may apply to all the main characters). 

 D&D lost their oomph, their passion and simply wanted it over, but weren't willing to leave what had been their baby in the hands of others.  So they chose to screw over those who gave a damn.",UgzOjQZfkBMHzYdpuvV4AaABAg,VeracityLH,1,1,2021-10-26T16:02:30Z,1

The showrunners clearly seemed to want out and just did what they thought was right. There were many objectively bad elements though like the Golden Army standing outside of the castle aside from the bad decisions made for story which caused it to be worse.",UgyKxU4O0zG197oAQx14AaABAg,SoulfulSoulfury,0,0,2021-06-01T19:05:45Z,0

81,"Watched from day 1, week by week.  Overall didn't hate season 8.  Yes it was rushed but Dani's turn was not out of character for me or didn't need more episodes (just watch some reactions of the bells scene and see how many people say ""don't do it"", it's  a lot, which proves it's not out of character,  just that she was a fan favorite).  She didn't need more fleshing out, when someone's snaps it just happens without rhyme or reason, I don't understand why people need more reasoning, without POV chapters like in the books its kinda hard to convey reasoning.  Jaime was my main disappointment, sleep with Brienne just to go back to Cersie, he must of snapped too.  Sansa and Brienne were my least favorite characters but Bran's story arc was boring af.",UgxNhTDAabXDrP-fOmJ4AaABAg,jojothatguy,0,0,2021-05-29T06:14:50Z,0

84,"Like it or not, Bran was the only character who had ""no skin in the game [of thrones]"". Yes, he had been mamed by Jamie, but as he kept saying truthfully, he was no longer that person. Bran was -- like it or not - the only character who would have no old grudges to settle or any old enemies seeking to settle any. As he had become something else, there was not even a grudge against Jamie when the two of them finally met again. As for Dany, she was always FATED to become ""the mad queen"". Jamie, after all, was justified in breaking his sworn oath to protect the very kind he killed because the king was mad, wishing to ""burn them all"" for no reason other than that madness. Never once did Dany even flinch when she first ordered her dragons to burn her perceived enemies. If her madness had demanded more to ""earn"" her actions, then Jon Snow would not have been justified in killing her. He was not her murderer so much as he was the liberator of the people, just as Jamie had been. The ""game of thrones"" was over the moment that Cersei determined that all of the people of Kings Landing could die for all she cared. She was the ultimate narcissist. Tyrion pleaded with her. Then he pleaded with Dany. And yet Cersie was unmovable and Dany was unstoppable. This was WHO they are. It should have been no surprise that death and destruction would be the only outcome. Unfortunately, however, we are conditioned to accept only Happy Hollywood Endings. Those expecting one here haven't been paying to the rest of Martin's story.",UgwRB-x0tDkGWrrE09h4AaABAg,Michael,121,3,2021-05-26T14:26:22Z,121

87,"Bran should have died during the winterfell battle. something with the tree and the red priestess and the lord of light. could have easily been the sacrifice that saved the day the last minute. 
I'd have been ok if Danni had burned innocent people in the red keep brought there by Cersei. it would have given John and Tyrion the red flag to kill her. 
i would have liked Drogon to back John onto the throne and then melt it with him seated.

89,"To be honest the reason i think Dany did what she did was because she had nothing left.

91,Btw your such a pompous douche bag.. not that you'll ever see this but if you do.. Fuck you and everything about the last season of this show.. if you liked anything about season 8 other than the fight scenes you have lost all credibility.... i do agree that season 8 should have been at the very least 10 episodes preferably 12.. they needed to flesh out a bit more of the night kings story.. obviously.. and they also should have fleshed out more of danny going from kind of being crazy to literally losing her mind.
